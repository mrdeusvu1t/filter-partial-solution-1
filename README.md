## Task Description ##

> Analyze solutions [Filter by digit task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/int-array-filter) and [Filter by palindromic task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/filter-by-palindromic) in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of matching the number with a certain attribute?    
> Using the capabilities of only static classes and methods, propose the option of allocating reusable code. Do not use LINQ and delegates.   
> Demonstrate the possibility of using developed code without changing with two different ways of matching the number to a specific attribute (see task conditions above). Place solutions in two separate projects.  
> Develop NUnit tests methods for both solutions.
