## Task Description ##

> Analyze solutions [Filter by digit task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/int-array-filter) and [Filter by palindromic task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/filter-by-palindromic) in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of matching the number with a certain attribute (predicate)?    
 - Using the capabilities of only static classes and methods (extension methods recommended), propose the option of allocating reusable code. **Do not use LINQ and delegates**.
 - Demonstrate the possibility of using common code with two different predicate of the number (see task conditions above). Place solutions in two separate solution (put second solution here).
 - Develop NUnit-test methods for both solutions.
